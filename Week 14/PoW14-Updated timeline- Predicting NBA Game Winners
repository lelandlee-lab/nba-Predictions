    "Our project aims to predict the winner of an NBA game before tip-off using information provided before the game starts. We use pregame data such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Team strengths and weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "-Recent performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "-Home vs away status\n",

    "-Back-to-back games and rest days\n",
    "\n",
    "-Player injuries and lineup availability\n",
    "\n",
    "-Offensive and defensive ratings \n",
    "\n",
    "-Travel and scheduling factors\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a binary classification problem where the goal is to determine whether Team A or Team B is more likely to win.\n",
    "We plan to test multiple models, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Logistic Regression (baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "-Additional ML models, depending on performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to identify which features and models produce the most accurate predictions of game outcomes."
